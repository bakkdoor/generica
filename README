                 generica - a simple lisp-like language

========================================================================

(goals)
  - implement a simple lisp-like language
  - have fun implementing it
  - use ANSI C for the interpreter and possibly no external dependencies
  - small codebase and fast compilation, if possible
  - this is just for fun and nothing really serious

(status)
  - development isn't really going anywhere - this was more or less
    merely a introduction of myself to language design & implementation
  - many memory leaks - in fact I've written such bad code, that there
    is nearly not one free() call in the entire codebase (shame on me!)
    -> I guess garbage collection (BoehmGC) would help here
  - feel free to use it as a learning reference or whatever :)
    I'm planning on implementing a (more serious) new Ruby-like
    language in C++ here soon.
